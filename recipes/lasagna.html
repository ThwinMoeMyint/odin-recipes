    <ol>
        <li>

            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.<br>
            Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally,<br>
            until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.<br>
            Drain, rinse with cold water, and set aside.<br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, place chicken in a saucepan with enough water to cover; bring to a boil.<br> 
            Cook until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes.<br>
            Remove chicken from the saucepan and shred.<br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine shredded chicken, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, and cream cheese in a large bowl.<br>
            Dissolve hot water and bouillon in a liquid measure;<br> 
            pour over chicken mixture and stir until well combined.<br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread 1/3 of the spaghetti sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.<br> 
            Cover with 1/2 of the chicken mixture and top with 3 lasagna noodles; repeat.<br>
            Top with remaining sauce and sprinkle with remaining 1 cup mozzarella cheese.<br>
            <br>
